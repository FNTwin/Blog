As I'm going to use this blog as some sort of work diary, I'll start with a heads up:

There will be *a lot* of molecular dynamics workflows (_with some 
python scripting by the side_) for a bit...hopefully I will find some time 
to do some interesting stuff with machine learning but for now I doubt it.

As for now, I'll try to post a render of the nanoparticle I'm working on and hopefully
the resolution will be decent enough...
